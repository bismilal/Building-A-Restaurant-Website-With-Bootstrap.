# Building-A-Restaurant-Website-With-Bootstrap.

Prerequisites: HTML 5, CSS and Bootstrap

HTML:  HTML stands for Hyper Text  Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages.
A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

BOOTSTRAP : Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 

It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. Nowadays, 

the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets,  and Phones). 
All thanks to Bootstrap developers â€“ Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.
